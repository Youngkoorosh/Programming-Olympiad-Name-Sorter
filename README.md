# 🧠 Programming Olympiad Name Sorter

A Python script that processes messy Olympiad registration entries and transforms them into a clean, organized list of contestants. It capitalizes names correctly, separates entries by gender, and displays the programming language used — all sorted alphabetically within each group.
